# dds-rtps
Validation of interoperability of products compliant with [OMG DDS-RTPS standard](http://www.omg.org/spec/DDSI-RTPS/). This is considered one of the core [DDS Specifications](http://portals.omg.org/dds/omg-dds-standard/). See http://portals.omg.org/dds/ for an overview of DDS.

The executables found on the [release tab of this repository](https://github.com/omg-dds/dds-rtps/releases) test discovery, DDS Topic and QoS matching, and interoperability for different QoS settings. The goal is to validate that the implementations perform these functions in compliance with OMG DDS-RTPS standard and can interoperate with each other.
